# Lower-Thirds-Control-Softron-OTA-CG-
Lower Thirds Control (Softron OTA CG)  The Lower Thirds Control is a page integrated with the Softron OnTheAir CG REST API for displaying lower thirds without the need to use the software, where we would have to edit and save each project independently.  With this, we can maintain a single project by only changing the text.
